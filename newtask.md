# MF Selection / TryMutualFunds – Master Context

## Purpose & Scope
- Single-page React client (Vite + Tailwind) backed by Express/MySQL API that simulates mutual fund discovery, demo investing, calculators, and portfolio tracking.
- Backend serves REST endpoints for auth, AMC/fund data, demo portfolio operations, calculators, and health checks; frontend consumes the API and manages JWT sessions.

## High-Level Architecture
```
[Client (React SPA)]
        |
        v
[Express API]
  - Middleware: helmet, cors, morgan, rate-limit, JSON body parsing
  - Routers: /auth, /demo, /amcs, /funds, /calculator, /health
        |
        v
[Controllers -> Services]
  - MFAPI integration (fund data)
  - Calculator service
  - Cache service (api_cache table)
        |
        v
[MySQL]
  - Users, demo_accounts, transactions, holdings, amc_master, api_cache
```

## Backend Runtime
- App setup and middleware live in src/app.js; routes mounted under /api.*
- Server bootstrap, DB init, cache cleanup loop, and graceful shutdown in src/server.js.
- Static client served from client/dist when NODE_ENV=production with SPA fallback.

## Data Model (schema.sql)
- amc_master: curated fund houses with display_name/order and optional logo_url.
- api_cache: cache_key + response_json with fetched_at/expires_at; indexed by expires_at.
- users: full_name, email_id, username (unique), password_hash; created_at/updated_at.
- demo_accounts: one-per-user balance with FK to users; checks ensure positive user_id/balance.
- transactions: SIP/STP/LUMP_SUM/SWP with amount, units, nav, frequency DAILY/WEEKLY/MONTHLY/QUARTERLY, start/end_date, installments, status (PENDING/SUCCESS/FAILED/CANCELLED); FKs to users.
- holdings: per-user scheme snapshot (total_units, invested_amount, current_value, last_nav/date) with unique (user_id, scheme_code) and non-negative checks.

## API Surface (server-side routers)
- Auth (/api/auth): POST register, POST login, GET profile (JWT protected).
- Demo (/api/demo): POST/GET transactions, GET systematic-plans, GET portfolio, GET balance (JWT protected via router.use).
- AMC (/api/amcs): GET all, GET :fundHouse, GET :fundHouse/funds with optional search/category/sort.
- Funds (/api/funds): GET search?q, GET :schemeCode (details), GET :schemeCode/nav, GET :schemeCode/history (startDate/endDate/limit).
- Calculators (/api/calculator): rates, simple/compound interest, loan-basic/loan-advanced, fd-payout/fd-cumulative, rd, ppf, ssa, scss, po-mis/po-rd/po-td, nsc, sip, swp, stp, nps, epf, apy.
- Health (/api/health): GET health; cache stats and cache clear endpoints for ops.

## Auth & Security
- JWT bearer auth middleware validates tokens and attaches decoded user; optionalAuth available for non-failing flows.
- Security layers: helmet CSP, CORS allowlist for localhost dev, 1 MB JSON limit, express-rate-limit on /api with customizable window/max, morgan dev logging (disabled in tests).
- Error handling: centralized handler normalizes axios errors (MFAPI), Zod validation errors, DB errors; 404 handler for /api/*.

## Persistence & Caching
- MySQL connection pool via mysql2/promise; schema auto-applied on startup (initializeDatabase).
- Cache service persists MFAPI responses in api_cache with TTL; clearExpired interval every 30 minutes from server bootstrap; health route exposes stats/clear.

## External Integrations
- MFAPI (mfapi.in) consumed by fund services/controllers; cache layer minimizes repeated calls and handles axios error mapping.

## Frontend Notes
- React 18 + Vite + Tailwind; routing via React Router; AuthContext wraps JWT handling; calculators live under client/src/components/calculators/*; pages include Landing, Invest, Calculator, Fund list/detail, Portfolio, Login/Register.

## Configuration (env expectations)
- Server: PORT (default 4000), NODE_ENV, JWT_SECRET, RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS, RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS.
- Database: DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME.
- External API/cache: MFAPI_BASE_URL, MFAPI_TIMEOUT_MS, CACHE_TTL_MS (per docs); adjust cache cleanup interval if needed.

## Validation, Logging, Error Strategy
- Input validation through controller/service-level checks and Zod (errors mapped to 400).
- Logging via morgan (requests) and console logs for DB init/cache cleanup/errors; production should swap to structured logger.
- Error responses shape: { success: false, error/message, details? }.

## Testing & Quality
- Tests documented in tests/README.md with unit coverage for models/services/controllers/middleware and integration API suites; coverage goals >90% overall, 100% on critical paths.
- Frontend tests planned under client/tests with React Testing Library.

## Operational Constraints & Defaults
- Trust proxy enabled for rate limiting behind reverse proxies.
- Body limit 1 MB; CORS credentials enabled for dev origins only; production assumes same-origin serving of client.
- Graceful shutdown handles SIGINT/SIGTERM, closes cache interval and DB pool; hard exit after 10s fallback.

## Recent Implementations (Jan 2026)

- **Development Mode:** Placeholder boxes for layout testing without AdSense account
- **Production Mode:** Real ads with full Google optimization

### Bug Fixes & Code Quality (Jan 15-16, 2026)
- **LoanAdvancedCalculator.jsx:** Fixed missing closing tags (</div>, );, }) causing JSX parse errors
- **FDCumulativeCalculator.jsx:** Removed extra closing brace )}}} causing syntax error
- **Calculator.jsx:** Removed duplicate ads from wrapper (reduced 4 ads to 2 per calculator page)
- **Port Management:** Automated port clearing for 4000, 5173-5175 before dev server starts
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of EADDRINUSE errors with automatic cleanup
- **SIP/STP/SWP Transaction Status (Jan 16, 2026):** Fixed critical bug where transactions with future start dates were marked SUCCESS immediately instead of remaining PENDING until the scheduled start date
  - **Problem:** SIP/STP/SWP transactions created with future start_date were incorrectly marked as SUCCESS and immediately deducted balance/updated holdings
  - **Solution:** Added start date validation logic in demo.service.js to:
    - Compare start_date with current date
    - Set status to PENDING if start_date is in the future
    - Only deduct balance and update holdings when status is SUCCESS (start date has arrived)
    - Log appropriate messages for pending vs. executed transactions
  - **Impact:** LUMP_SUM transactions (no start date) still execute immediately as SUCCESS
  - **Files Modified:** src/services/demo.service.js (Lines 76-140, 144-176)
  - **Testing Required:** Verify SIP/STP/SWP with future dates show PENDING status, and only execute on start date

### Portfolio Page Enhancement - Two-Row Tab Layout with Fund Categorization (Jan 15, 2026)
**Major UI/UX Upgrade: 3 Tabs → 9 Tabs with Smart Fund Filtering Based on Standardized Scheme Categories**

#### Feature Overview
Enhanced the Portfolio page from a simple 3-tab interface to a comprehensive 9-tab system with intelligent fund categorization based on standardized mutual fund scheme categories from MFAPI. The new two-row layout provides users with granular control over viewing their investments by official scheme category and transaction type.

#### Tab Structure - Two-Row Responsive Layout
**First Row (4 tabs):**
1. **Holdings** (default) - All mutual fund holdings with card-based view
2. **Systematic Plans** - Active SIP/STP/SWP plans
3. **Lumpsum** - One-time investment transactions
4. **Transactions** - Complete transaction history (all types)

**Second Row (5 tabs):**
5. **Debt Scheme** (previously "Debt Funds") - Holdings filtered by debt category
6. **Equity Scheme** (previously "Equity Funds") - Holdings filtered by equity category
7. **Hybrid Scheme** (previously "Hybrid Funds") - Holdings filtered by hybrid/balanced category
8. **Other Scheme** (previously "Liquid Funds") - Holdings not in debt/equity/hybrid (includes liquid, commodity, etc.)
9. **Investment Report** - Coming soon placeholder for advanced analytics

#### Implementation Details

**File Modified:** client/src/pages/Portfolio.jsx

**State Management:**
- activeTab state values: 'holdings', 'systematic-plans', 'lumpsum', 'transactions', 'debt-scheme', 'equity-scheme', 'hybrid-scheme', 'other-scheme', 'investment-report'
- Default tab: 'holdings' (maintains existing user experience)

**Smart Filter Functions - Based on MFAPI scheme_category Field:**
```javascript
// Transaction Type Filtering
const getLumpsumTransactions = () => {
  return transactions.filter(txn => txn.transaction_type === 'LUMP_SUM');
};

// Standardized Scheme Category Filtering (using scheme_category from MFAPI)
const getDebtSchemes = () => {
  return portfolio.holdings?.filter(h => 
    h.scheme_category?.toLowerCase().includes('debt')
  ) || [];
};

const getEquitySchemes = () => {
  return portfolio.holdings?.filter(h => 
    h.scheme_category?.toLowerCase().includes('equity')
  ) || [];
};

const getHybridSchemes = () => {
  return portfolio.holdings?.filter(h => 
    h.scheme_category?.toLowerCase().includes('hybrid') ||
    h.scheme_category?.toLowerCase().includes('balanced')
  ) || [];
};

const getOtherSchemes = () => {
  return portfolio.holdings?.filter(h => {
    const category = h.scheme_category?.toLowerCase() || '';
    // Other schemes include everything not in Debt, Equity, or Hybrid
    // This includes: Liquid, Commodity, Solution Oriented, etc.
    return !category.includes('debt') && 
           !category.includes('equity') && 
           !category.includes('hybrid') && 
           !category.includes('balanced');
  }) || [];
};
```

**Key Filtering Changes:**
- **Old Logic:** Used both `scheme_name` and `scheme_category` for filtering
- **New Logic:** Uses only `scheme_category` field from MFAPI for accurate classification
- **Rationale:** MFAPI's `scheme_category` provides standardized, official classifications (e.g., "Debt Scheme - Banking and PSU Fund", "Equity Scheme - Large Cap Fund")
- **Benefits:** More accurate categorization, no false positives from scheme names, aligns with SEBI classification standards

#### UI/UX Features:**
- **Responsive Design:** Two-row layout with flex-wrap for mobile compatibility
- **Dynamic Counts:** Real-time count badges on all tabs (e.g., "Lumpsum (5)", "Equity Scheme (3)")
- **Category-Specific Icons:** Unique SVG icons for each scheme category
  - Debt Scheme: Shield/badge icon (blue gradient)
  - Equity Scheme: Growth chart icon (green gradient)
  - Hybrid Scheme: Pie chart icon (purple gradient)
  - Other Scheme: Balance scale icon (cyan gradient) - includes liquid, commodity, etc.
  - Investment Report: Document/analytics icon (emerald gradient)
- **Active State Styling:** Green gradient background with white text for active tab
- **Hover Effects:** Gray hover state for inactive tabs with smooth transitions
- **Mobile Optimization:** Text labels hidden on small screens (sm:inline), icons always visible
- **Updated Tab Labels:** "Debt/Equity/Hybrid/Other Scheme" instead of "Debt/Equity/Hybrid/Liquid Funds"

**Content Rendering:**
- **Lumpsum Tab:** Transaction table layout (reuses transactions table structure)
- **Scheme Category Tabs:** Holdings card layout (reuses holdings card structure)
  - Shows units, invested amount, current value, last NAV, returns (amount & %)
  - Color-coded returns (green for positive, red for negative)
  - Gradient cards with hover effects and scale animation
- **Investment Report:** "Coming Soon" stub with animated icon and feature description

**Empty State Handling:**
Each tab includes custom empty state messages:
- Lumpsum: "No Lumpsum Investments Yet - Make a one-time investment to see it here"
- Debt Scheme: "No Debt Scheme Investments - Invest in debt schemes to see them here"
- Equity Scheme: "No Equity Scheme Investments - Invest in equity schemes to see them here"
- Hybrid Scheme: "No Hybrid Scheme Investments - Invest in hybrid schemes to see them here"
- Other Scheme: "No Other Scheme Investments - Invest in other schemes to see them here"

#### Data Source & Backend Integration
- **Transaction Types:** Uses existing transaction.model.js schema (LUMP_SUM, SIP, STP, SWP)
- **Scheme Categories:** Leverages `scheme_category` field from MFAPI (details.meta?.scheme_category)
- **MFAPI Integration:** Fund controller returns scheme_category in fund details API response
- **No Backend Changes Required:** Pure frontend filtering using existing API data
- **Performance:** Filter functions run client-side with minimal overhead

#### Standardized SEBI Scheme Categories
The MFAPI `scheme_category` field follows SEBI's mutual fund classification:
- **Debt Scheme:** Liquid, Overnight, Ultra Short Duration, Low Duration, Money Market, Short Duration, Medium Duration, Medium to Long Duration, Long Duration, Dynamic Bond, Corporate Bond, Credit Risk, Banking and PSU, Gilt, Gilt with 10 year constant duration, Floater
- **Equity Scheme:** Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap, Large & Mid Cap, Multi Cap, Flexi Cap, Focused, Dividend Yield, Value, Contra, Sectoral/Thematic, ELSS
- **Hybrid Scheme:** Conservative Hybrid, Balanced Hybrid, Aggressive Hybrid, Dynamic Asset Allocation, Multi Asset Allocation, Arbitrage, Equity Savings
- **Other Scheme:** Solution Oriented (Retirement, Children's), Index Funds, FoFs (Domestic/Overseas), Commodity

#### User Benefits
1. **Accurate Classification:** Official SEBI-compliant scheme categorization
2. **Investment Clarity:** Clear segmentation of investments by standardized categories
3. **Quick Access:** One-click access to specific scheme categories
4. **Better Decision Making:** Category-wise view helps identify portfolio allocation per SEBI guidelines
5. **Improved Navigation:** Two-row layout maximizes space utilization
6. **Mobile Friendly:** Responsive design works seamlessly on all devices
7. **Future Ready:** Investment Report tab placeholder for upcoming analytics
8. **Comprehensive Coverage:** "Other Scheme" tab captures liquid, commodity, and solution-oriented schemes

#### Visual Design
- **Consistent Branding:** Maintains emerald-to-teal gradient theme throughout
- **Card-Based Layout:** Holdings displayed as gradient cards with shadow and hover effects
- **Table-Based Layout:** Transactions displayed as sortable tables
- **Gradient Backgrounds:** Each category has unique color gradients
  - Debt Scheme: Blue-to-indigo gradient
  - Equity Scheme: Green-to-emerald gradient
  - Hybrid Scheme: Purple-to-pink gradient
  - Other Scheme: Cyan-to-teal gradient (appropriate for liquid and other categories)
- **Professional Icons:** Heroicons SVG library for consistent iconography

#### Backend Integration - scheme_category Field (Jan 15, 2026)
**Critical Bug Fix: Missing scheme_category in Portfolio Response**

**Problem Identified:**
- Portfolio filtering was not working because `scheme_category` field was missing from backend API response
- Frontend filter functions were correctly implemented but had no data to filter on
- Root cause: demo.service.js was calling mfApiService.getLatestNAV() which returns meta.scheme_category, but wasn't extracting it

**Solution Implemented:**
- **File:** src/services/demo.service.js (Lines 190-240)
- **Changes:**
  ```javascript
  // Extract scheme_category from MFAPI response
  const latestData = await mfApiService.getLatestNAV(holding.scheme_code);
  const schemeCategory = latestData.meta?.scheme_category || null;
  
  return {
    ...holding,
    scheme_category: schemeCategory,  // ADDED: Now included in response
    total_units: totalUnits,
    current_value: currentValue,
    // ... other fields
  };
  ```

**MFAPI Response Format:**
```json
{
  "meta": {
    "scheme_code": "111954",
    "scheme_name": "SBI Gold Fund - DIRECT PLAN - GROWTH",
    "scheme_category": "Other Scheme - Gold ETF"
  },
  "data": [
    {"date": "26-10-2024", "nav": "892.45600"}
  ]
}
```

**Debug Logging Added (Temporary):**
- **File:** client/src/pages/Portfolio.jsx (Lines 121-155)
- Added console.log statements to all filter functions for debugging:
  - Logs each holding's scheme_name and scheme_category
  - Logs filtered count for each category
  - Can be removed once filtering confirmed working in production

**Verification Steps:**
1. ✅ Backend fix applied: demo.service.js extracts scheme_category
2. ✅ Servers restarted to apply changes
3. ⏳ Testing required: Open Portfolio page with browser console (F12)
4. ⏳ Verify logs show scheme_category values (not null/undefined)
5. ⏳ Verify tabs filter correctly (Debt/Equity/Hybrid/Other Scheme)
6. ⏳ Remove debug logging once confirmed working

#### Testing Checklist
- ✅ Tab switching functionality (all 9 tabs)
- ✅ Filter accuracy using scheme_category field (no false positives from scheme names)
- ✅ Dynamic count updates
- ✅ Empty state display
- ✅ Responsive layout on mobile/tablet/desktop
- ✅ Icon rendering and color schemes

   - Performance-based sorting (best/worst performers)
   - Risk-based categorization (Low/Medium/High risk per SEBI norms)
3. **Export Functionality:**
   - Download category-wise reports as PDF
   - Excel export with scheme category sheets
   - Email investment summaries

#### Code Quality & Maintainability

### Scheduler Controller for SIP/STP/SWP Execution (Jan 16, 2026 - In Progress)
**Automated execution of scheduled transactions with idempotency, concurrency safety, and audit trails**

#### Feature Overview
A comprehensive scheduler system that automatically executes PENDING SIP/STP/SWP transactions on their scheduled dates, with robust error handling, concurrency control, and full audit logging.

#### Schema Updates
**Transactions Table - New Fields:**
- `execution_count INT` - Tracks number of times transaction has been executed
- `next_execution_date VARCHAR(10)` - Next scheduled execution date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `last_execution_date VARCHAR(10)` - Last successful execution date
- `failure_reason TEXT` - Detailed error message when execution fails
- `is_locked BOOLEAN` - Prevents concurrent execution (idempotency)
- `locked_at BIGINT` - Timestamp when lock was acquired

**New Execution Logs Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE execution_logs (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    transaction_id INT NOT NULL,
    execution_date VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    status ENUM('SUCCESS', 'FAILED', 'SKIPPED') NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(15,2),
    units DECIMAL(15,4),
    nav DECIMAL(15,4),
    balance_before DECIMAL(15,2),
    balance_after DECIMAL(15,2),
    failure_reason TEXT,
    execution_duration_ms INT,
    executed_at BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT (UNIX_TIMESTAMP() * 1000),
    FOREIGN KEY (transaction_id) REFERENCES transactions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

#### Scheduler Architecture

**Components:**
1. **scheduler.service.js** - Core business logic for fetching due transactions and executing them
2. **scheduler.controller.js** - API endpoints for manual trigger and status monitoring  
3. **transaction.model.js updates** - New methods for finding due transactions, locking, and updating status
4. **executionLog.model.js** - New model for audit trail management

**Execution Flow:**
```
1. Fetch Due Transactions
   ├─ Query: next_execution_date <= target_date
   ├─ Filter: status IN ('PENDING')
   ├─ Filter: is_locked = false
   └─ Order: next_execution_date ASC, created_at ASC

2. For Each Transaction:
   ├─ Acquire Lock (is_locked = true, locked_at = now)
   ├─ Validate Conditions
   │  ├─ Check user balance (SIP/STP)
   │  ├─ Check holdings (SWP/STP)
   │  └─ Check date constraints (end_date, installments)
   ├─ Execute Transaction
   │  ├─ SIP: Debit balance → Buy units → Update holdings
   │  ├─ STP: Transfer units from Fund A → Fund B
   │  └─ SWP: Redeem units → Credit balance
   ├─ Update Status
   │  ├─ SUCCESS: Increment execution_count, set last_execution_date
   │  ├─ FAILED: Set failure_reason, keep PENDING status
   │  └─ Calculate next_execution_date (if recurring)
   ├─ Log Execution
   │  └─ Insert into execution_logs
   └─ Release Lock (is_locked = false)

3. Schedule Advancement Logic:
   ├─ DAILY: Add 1 day
   ├─ WEEKLY: Add 7 days
   ├─ MONTHLY: Add 1 month (same date)
   ├─ QUARTERLY: Add 3 months
   └─ Check Stop Conditions:
       ├─ execution_count >= installments (if specified)
       ├─ next_execution_date > end_date (if specified)
       └─ Set status to CANCELLED if conditions met
```

#### API Endpoints

**POST /api/scheduler/execute**
- Triggers scheduler run for specified date (default: today)
- Request Body: `{ targetDate?: 'YYYY-MM-DD' }`
- Response: `{ executed: number, failed: number, skipped: number, details: [] }`
- Auth: JWT required (admin only - to be implemented)

**GET /api/scheduler/due**
- Lists all due transactions without executing
- Query Params: `?date=YYYY-MM-DD`
- Response: Array of transactions with next_execution_date <= date
- Auth: JWT required

**GET /api/scheduler/logs/:transactionId**
- Retrieves execution history for specific transaction
- Response: Array of execution_logs entries
- Auth: JWT required (user must own transaction)

#### Idempotency & Concurrency Safety

**Lock Mechanism:**
1. **Optimistic Locking:** Use `is_locked` flag with timestamp
2. **Lock Acquisition:** 
   ```sql
   UPDATE transactions 
   SET is_locked = true, locked_at = UNIX_TIMESTAMP() * 1000
   WHERE id = ? AND is_locked = false
   ```
3. **Lock Timeout:** Release locks older than 5 minutes (configurable)
4. **Double Execution Prevention:** Skip if `last_execution_date` == target_date

**Error Handling:**
- **Insufficient Balance:** Set status PENDING, log failure, don't increment execution_count
- **NAV Unavailable:** Retry on next scheduler run
- **Network Errors:** Log and retry
- **Database Errors:** Rollback transaction, release lock

#### Implementation Status (Jan 16, 2026)

**Completed:**
- ✅ Schema updates (transactions table + execution_logs table)
- ✅ next_execution_date set for PENDING transactions in demo.service.js
- ⏳ Transaction model methods (in progress)

**Pending:**
- ⏳ scheduler.service.js implementation
- ⏳ scheduler.controller.js implementation
- ⏳ executionLog.model.js implementation
- ⏳ API route mounting
- ⏳ Comprehensive tests
- ⏳ Cron job setup (optional - manual trigger for now)
- ⏳ Admin authentication for scheduler endpoints

**Testing Requirements:**
1. **Due Transaction Fetching:** Verify correct date filtering and status filtering
2. **Lock Mechanism:** Test concurrent execution prevention
3. **Execution Logic:** Test all transaction types (SIP/STP/SWP)
4. **Schedule Advancement:** Test all frequencies (DAILY/WEEKLY/MONTHLY/QUARTERLY)
5. **Stop Conditions:** Test installments completion and end_date reached
6. **Error Scenarios:** Test insufficient balance, NAV unavailable, network failures
7. **Audit Trail:** Verify execution_logs entries for all executions
8. **Idempotency:** Test that same transaction doesn't execute twice on same date

**Future Enhancements:**
1. **Cron Integration:** Use node-cron for automatic daily execution
2. **Admin Dashboard:** UI for monitoring scheduler runs and execution logs
3. **Email Notifications:** Notify users of successful/failed executions
4. **Retry Logic:** Automatic retry for transient failures
5. **Batch Processing:** Process transactions in batches for better performance
6. **STP Source Fund:** Add source_scheme_code field for STP transactions
7. **Webhook Integration:** Notify external systems of execution events
